# Newton Raphson Method
This is the basics of how to apply Newton-Raphson method to approximate root value of a function.
A quick summary of NR method can be found as a file named under newton-raphson-method-cheatsheet.png .
The code to implement NR method in R can be found as a file named under R_implementation.R .
Additionally, you can find NR method applied in real life, specifically in the genomics research field, as a file named under 2018_Zheng_Jeong.pdf (See Fig. 2 on page 6 of the file).
